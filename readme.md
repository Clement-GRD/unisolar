# Unisolar Project
This project is based on the **UNISOLAR** open dataset containing information on solar energy production and weather in various locations of the La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia, stored in a time series format.

The main goal of this project will be to forecast energy production based on previous production and weather data with a horizon of 24 hours.
